# mission_schools has a GPT4 sourced set of schools.

# There's 169 school districts in BC and this is just one below for Missiom.
# mission is hard coded a few times in here, which isn't optimal.

# GPT Prompt I used:
# All mission public school district (BC) schools in a python dict like so ```mission_schools = [
#    {"school_name": "School Name", "address": "400 Street St+Town+CT 12345", "students": 1234,
#    "website": "URL, "phone": "123 456 7890"}]``` please

# After you generate the markdown from this script, also run `python3 make_grade_subtotals_and_totals.py`
